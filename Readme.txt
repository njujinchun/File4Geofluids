This directory contains the input files for the FLOLA-Voronoi algorithm and for the simulation simulator (TOUGH2/ECO2M) used in the manuscript entitled "An adaptive global surrogate method for efficient uncertainty quantification in geological carbon sequestration modeling¡± by Mo, Shi, Lu and Ye.

It is noted that, the executable program driver1M.exe using to interface the FLOLA-Voronoi and simulation model is a linux executable.
